The Player
----------
1. The player should start out with about 40 to 80 gold

Monsters
--------
1. Monsters should have about 4 to 8 hit points per level, 1 to 4 for
   level 0
2. Experience given should be about (maximum damage)*(((level)^2)/3)
3. Regular monsters should carry about 2 to 6 gold per level

Weapons
-------
1. Hit roll bonuses are done in % (not on 1d20 like in other RPGs),
   so generally you want to multiply your + by 5, eg. a "sword +3"
   would have +3 to damage, and +15 to hit

   roll bonuses (%)
